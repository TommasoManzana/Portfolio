The goal of the project was to create a Mobile and Web Application to manage a ski team. The application needed to manage different groups of skiers and instructors, collect information for each workout or race, and provide analytical insights through a single skier profile. Challenges encountered included:

- designing the user interface to be user-friendly
- catering to industry-specific requirements
- ensuring scalability and ease of updating.

Such a commission has been given by one of the most prestigious ski teams in Italy, the [Falconeri Ski Team](https://falconeriskiteam.net/).

## Tools

The app was developed using the [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/), written in [Angular](https://angular.io/), with authentication managed by Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). At first the backend was on Firebase as well but was later moved to a proprietary server and developed via SQL.


## Learning Experience

Developing this application taught us a lot about app development, backend database management and UI/UX design, including the significance of user-centric design, industry-specific requirements, and scalability. The project was a fulfilling experience, and the resulting application effectively meets the needs of the Falconeri Ski Team.

Thanks to the success brought by the [Hackathon](/blog/UniTn-Hackathon) the SkiRaceGenie team was contacted by FIS which requested the game to be presented in Cortina!
You can read more about the [pre-game hype here](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/international-ski-federation/news-multimedia/news-2022/ski-race-genie-the-first-live-fan-engagement-app-in-wintersports#:~:text=SKI%20RACE%20GENIE%20%E2%80%93%20The%20first%20Live%20Fan%20Engagement%20App%20in%20Wintersports&text=Following%20the%20path%20traced%20by,will%20be%20presented%20in%20Cortina.).
The game was even covered on major news outlets such as [SkySport](https://sport.sky.it/altri-sport/sci/2022/01/21/sci-cortina-app-fan-engagement)

The game was a huge success, presented on the 22nd of January during the female's Downhill race and on the 23rd of January during the female's SuperG.
